# MyPv HomeAssistant Integration

Hello!

So you have found my repository. This repository is about a custom integration of a MyPv heating element into my Home-Assistant setup. The repository is public because I am integrating it via HACS. The name of the repository is a bit unusual because I don't want too much attention on it. :)

Since you have somehow found this repository, feel free to look around. If you also use Home-Assistant and a MyPv heating element and are looking for something like this, feel free to use the integration. Information about the integration can be found in the [INFO.md](INFO.md).

Enjoy!
